Applied online Kalman Filter and time series ARIMA models to implement short-term forecast of COVID19

Total confirmed COVID19 cases in the countries and the USA states are forecasted up until March 22, 2020. Fitting time series analysis and statistical algorithms are implemented to produce the best short term prediciton. An online Kelman filter, which runs in real-time, provides a very good one-day prediction for countries and the USA states, and time series ARIMA models generate impressive 9-day advance predictions for the USA and Italy.
